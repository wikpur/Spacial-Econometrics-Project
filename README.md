# Spacial-Econometrics-Project
The aim of this project is to analyze whether there are any spatial trends and patterns of the property crimes, focusing on crimes of theft in Poland in regards to all the voievodships and explores how socio-economic characteristics - unemployment rate, poverty rate, average gross monthly salary and population density affect crime rates with consideration of the geographic context across Poland and distinguish the clusters with the highest amount of that kind of crimes comparing 2018 and 2021. It is assumed that the number of crimes committed is directly proportional to the population density of cities, meaning we expect a greater number of thefts in larger urban areas. We also assume that there is direct proportional relationship between unemployment rate and crimes of theft (the higher rate of unemployment, the higher amount of crimes of theft), direct proportional relationship between poverty rate and crimes of theft (the higher rate of poverty, the higher amount of crimes of theft) inverse relationship between average gross monthly salary and crimes of theft (the higher amount of average gross monthly salary, the lower amount of crimes of theft). 
What should be taken into consideration during examination is that Polish law indicates that theft with a value not exceeding 500 PLN is considered a misdemeanor, not a crime. Reporting such theft will not be considered or processed, so there is no point in reporting them. Such a situation causes a disturbance between the actual amount of thefts and the recorded ones, since people has no incentive to report a theft under 500 PLN.
